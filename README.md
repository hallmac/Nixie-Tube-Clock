# Nixie-Tube-Clock

## Purpose

This project is part of the Oregon State Retro Electronics Club 2019-20 yearly club effort. This project aims to bring the warm Soviet glow of Nixie Tubes into the homes of all that invite it. This project delivers a simple, easy to assemble PCB that allows for a genuine Soviet Nixie Tube experience for about $100.
